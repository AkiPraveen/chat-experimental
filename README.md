# Chat Experimental

> Never speak to another human again. Have incredibly sophisticated discussions with top tier models. (excellent example of a riveting discussion pictured above)

Simple chat client where multiple users can connect, tag AI models and chat with them. Built using CloudFlare Durable Objects for websockets, [CloudFlare AI](https://ai.cloudflare.com/) for LLM inference, and [CloudFlare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/) using the [Hono framework](https://hono.dev/) for a lightweight backend. The frontend is a simple [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) app styled using [ShadCN UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components.
